						<p>As kids who grew up in the 90s, we all have a special place for Nintendo games in our heart, we grew up alongside graphic development, and feel a strong tie to these games. So, when it came time to develop a game for fun, using Leap Motion, Mario Kart 64 was simply a no-brainer. We felt there was no better way to engage our target audience — other students our age — than bring them back to a childhood favorite, and allow them to be one step closer to the game by using real lifelike motions to play the game.</p>

						<p>Our team took a spin on virtual reality, and thought about it as designing for our future world. Specifically, we wanted to consider what it was like for computation to transport users to another place. Of course, there is no place we know better than where we've studied for our Bachelor's degree at, therefore we decided to <a href="http://eg.bucknell.edu/~emp017/hci/designs/vr_assn.html">design for another world</a> by redesiging Bucknell in the future. The objective of our futuristic design for Bucknell was to invoke nostalgia yet provoke a sense of awe from technological advancements. What parts of Bucknell would people feel nostalgic about?</p>

						<p>For our Design for Others project, we created a prototype for the Bucknell Campus Theatre mobile application which specifically targeted Lewisburg, PA visitors. Our main hope was that through our app, we could convince visitors why they should see a screening of a movie at the Campus Theatre rather than at another chain movie theater in the area. While other theaters may be playing the most current movies our goal was that after visiting our mobile app they’d be convinced why they should come for the experience of the Campus Theatre instead. In order to do this, we focused on selling the Campus Theatre experience. For our final design, we wanted to emphasize exactly this: the experience and the unique history the theatre has, making it easy for the user to navigate to only the most important information, and really emphasize why they should want to come to the Campus Theatre. Through minimal clutter on the menu screens, quick access to the 360 tour to show off the theatre, and screens that were efficient and only gave the information necessary to visitors of the theatre, we hoped to show off how fantastic of an experience a visitor can have at the Campus Theatre.</p>

						<p>The problem that we are working on is regarding the mobilization of the Islamic State militant group called ISIS. While there are many very important parts of ISIS that are integral in understanding their growth and mobilization, one thing we will be focusing on is their growth as an organization and how they spread information together. What is important is the way that ISIS has been mobilizing and the difficulty many secret government agencies have had in trying to track them. They have been utilizing the usage of social media, specifically twitter which is where our dataset derives from. Since the Paris attacks in November of 2016, there have been over 17,000 tweets from more than 100 Pro-ISIS twitter accounts that have been scraped; this is the data that we will be using. The data consists of the following attributes: name, username, description, location, follower, numberstatuses, time, tweets. Numberstatuses refers to the number of statuses by the user when the tweet was downloaded and followers refers to the number of followers at the time the tweet was downloaded. The last attribute is the character string of the tweet itself.</p>

						<p>Welcome to Buckopoly the Bucknell University themed Monopoly game. Our version of the game can be played with up to
						four players on a single device. Our mission was to design the game with all of the classic board
						game’s functionality, taking into account how the interface should look and all of the different
						interactions a user may complete on any given piece throughout a game. We initially broke the
						game down into its core components, such as landing on a piece on a piece of property, buying
						that property, as well as buying and selling houses and other different user interactions that
						depended on a certain user’s position on the board at a given time. This not only included what
						each user would be able to do, but how each user would interact with the game board.</p>

						<p>Social media plays a huge role in the way people interact and communicate with one another. From sharing pictures of what you ate for dinner, to writing a post in response to current events, social media has created a new platform, and community for individuals to interact upon. One thing that ties major companies like Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook together is the way they use images to connect and engage with their users. Users share pictures with their friends and followers, and in return, social media sites will filter these posts and cater advertisements that are similar in return. This is particularly important because of the newly interconnectedness of social media sites and advertising. Where advertisements used to only exist on the side of buildings, in magazines and on television, they are now harder to avoid as they fall seamlessly into newsfeeds, alongside news articles and in between videos. This is an exceptionally important topic to address given the fact that studies also show how advertisements have increasingly negative effects on the way men and women perceive themselves. This paper will discuss the responsibility of social media outlets, specifically Instagram and how they influence the increasingly negative attitude twenty-first century women have with their bodies. Various ethical frameworks, such as ethical egoism and rule utilitarianism will help further understand the complicated nature of this dilemma and further analyze who is to blame

						<p>They say that chivalry is dead. And make no mistake, this article has nothing to do with chivalry except for if it truly is gone, has it taken originality with it? It’s no mystery that this twenty-first century world in which we live is upbeat, fast-paced, and ever-changing. The flip phone I had less than ten years ago is now an artifact to be seen at the Smithsonian Museum in Washington D.C, and the myriad of Abercrombie & Fitch t-shirts I once wore every single day is now hopefully in a better place (mostly because it’s not in my closet). While technology seems to be updating every day, it doesn’t seem that all other trends are following in its path. For example, if Apple doesn’t come out with a new iPhone update every year or so, they will soon find themselves irrelevant, or subject to a company takeover. Yet, some of the most popular brands from the 90’s, like Adidas and Converse (who haven’t changed their signature looks in over a decade) seem to be some of the most popular brands bought today. The latest trends in fashion and music, and sometimes even technology, are simply recycled trends from years past. And while there is nothing wrong with that, it raises a very important question: where do we go from here?
<br><br>If you’ve been keeping up with New York Fashion Week, or just following a few fashion bloggers and icons on Instagram, you’ll notice that some of the latest and hottest trends are simply just improved trends from years past. Bell bottoms, Adidas Superstars, and even flash tattoos are just a few of the trends that are making their way back into the fashion world. In fact, as I was doing some ‘Back to College’ shopping I mentioned to my dad that I wanted a pair of Adidas Superstars and he nearly choked on his water. He couldn’t believe that the tennis shoes I once begged him to not put on because I thought they looked weird had become something that I now thought of as stylish enough to wear myself. Similarly, I vividly remember getting temporary tattoos in gift bags after going to birthday parties as a little kid and immediately wanting to cover myself in them. Unfortunately, my mom didn’t allow them because she thought they looked silly. Fortunately, my inner pre-teen is finally being appeased these days as temp-tats are back, they’re just shinier and hipper than ever.
<br><br>It’s not just fashion that’s repeating itself; music and technology seem to be stealing from the past as well. Even with our technological abilities growing exponentially every day, we cannot seem to shake the great items from years past. While you now have the ability to take professional-looking photos with your iPhone, one of today’s most popular cameras is a Polaroid camera. Additionally, there have been quite a few lawsuits between musicians, with one claiming rights to a song that the other claims they already wrote. While there may truly be a finite number music notes combinations that can be created, and an even smaller number that is appealing within a certain genre of music, it seems very unlikely that in just 2015 we have reached our music maximum and nothing new can ever be created again.
<br><br>Now, some may say that we are simply a society that is learning from the past in order to better our future. And while this is a very supportive and constructive system, it does have its downsides. Without any new ideas being generated and by simply relying on our past successes, we are creating a world in which artists, designers, musicians, and all other creative minds will begin to dwindle without any new inspiration. Make no mistake, I don’t think that the end is near or that we’ve even come close to reaching our creative capacity. I simply believe that our world relies heavily on social consciousness, and the number of individuals willing to step outside the box is shrinking. It’s with you, however, the creative thinkers and believers, that we begin to create a chain reaction of inspiration that spirals into the next generation. A wise person once told me, “originality is when something seems so obviously clear as if it already exists, but it doesn’t.” So for the sake of your children, and your children’s children, think hard, think deeply and think passionately; find that originality within yourself and share it with the world. </p>
